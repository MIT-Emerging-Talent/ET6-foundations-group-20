"""
This module provides a function that generates a list of numbers from 1 to n 
with specific rules for multiples of 3 and 5.

For each number in the range:
- For multiples of 3, "Fizz" is added instead of the number.
- For multiples of 5, "Buzz" is added instead of the number.
- For multiples of both 3 and 5, "FizzBuzz" is added instead of the number.

Features:
- Input validation to ensure that the input is a positive integer.
- Customizable output format (e.g., changing the words "Fizz" and "Buzz" 
  to user-defined strings).
- Ability to generate results as a string instead of a list.

Example:
>>> fizz_buzz(15)
[1, 2, 'Fizz', 4, 'Buzz', 'Fizz', 7, 8, 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 11, 'Fizz', 13, 
  14, 'FizzBuzz']

def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> list:
    """
    Generates a list of numbers from 1 to n with the following rules:
    - For multiples of 3, "Fizz" is added instead of the number.
    - For multiples of 5, "Buzz" is added instead of the number.
    - For multiples of both 3 and 5, "FizzBuzz" is added instead of the number.

    Parameters:
    n (int): The upper limit of the range (inclusive) to generate.

    Returns:
    list: A list containing the numbers and/or string representations according 
    to the rules.

    Raises:
    TypeError: If the input is not an integer.
    ValueError: If the input is less than 1.

    Example:
    >>> fizz_buzz(10)
    [1, 2, 'Fizz', 4, 'Buzz', 'Fizz', 7, 8, 'Fizz', 'Buzz']
