"""
This module contains unit tests for the count_vowels module.
It includes test cases for the following function:
- count_vowels: Test the function that counts vowels in a string.

Tests cover various cases including normal strings, empty strings, and case insensitivity.

Usage:
    Run tests using unittest framework:
    >>> python -m unittest test_vowel_counter.py
