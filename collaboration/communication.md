## Asking for Help

### **Knowing When to Seek Help** 🤔💡  

Striking the right balance between confident problem-solving and getting stuck
in a loop can be tricky.
Here’s a simple guide to help you decide when it’s time to reach out:  

1. **_0 → 30 minutes_**: 🚀 Dive in and give it your best shot solo!  
2. **_30 → 60 minutes_**: 🤝 Team up! Discuss with your group and
brainstorm solutions together.  
3. **_60+ minutes_**: 🆘 Call in reinforcements! Tag your coaches on **Slack** or
**GitHub** for expert guidance.

Remember, **404s** are here, we got your back 🫂
