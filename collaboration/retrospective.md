# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

- Writing incomplete commit messages ❌
- Doing too many commits for minor changes ❌

## Continue Doing

- Checking the project board regularly.
- Asking teammates if any help is needed.
- Maintaining a clean and structured repository with clear README documentation.
- Following the rule: 1 task = 1 branch.

## Start Doing

- Optimize amount of branches, commits to avoid cluttering the project.

## Lessons Learned

- Effective use of pull requests helped improve code quality
- and catch bugs early ✅
- Frequent syncing with the remote repository avoided merge conflicts ✅

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

Pull requests were reviewed and merged according to the workflow plan.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

Overall, we completed our project quota. While some minor ideas were not fully implemented,
we kept the ones with potential and iterated on them as the project progressed.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?
<!--- add more -->

### Or remove extra steps?

- Stopped requiring a review for very small, trivial changes to save time.
