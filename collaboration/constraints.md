# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

## External

<!--
  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over:
  - project deadlines
  - number of unit tests required to pass a code review
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
  - power or connectivity
  - ...
-->

- **Connectivity issues**: Some team members may experience unreliable network
  connections, impacting real-time collaboration.

## Internal: Involuntary

<!--
  constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over:
  - each of your individual skill levels
  - amount of time available to work on the project
-->

- **Individual skill levels**: The team has varying levels of
  programming expertise which may affect task assignments and peer reviews.
- **Available time for project work**: Due to significant time zone
  differences, scheduling meetings can be challenging.

## Internal: Voluntary

<!--
  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:
  - coding style & conventions
  - agree on a code review checklist for the project repository
  - the number of hours you want to spend working
  - only using the colors black and white
-->

- **Coding style & conventions**: Agree on a set of guidelines
  for consistency across the codebase.
- **Code review checklist**: Create a checklist to ensure thorough
  reviews while accommodating varying skill levels.
- **Desired hours to work per week**: Establish a flexible schedule
  that considers team members' availability, possibly utilizing
  asynchronous communication.
